### 1.5 Document Overview
➥ The following document would cover the Quicklets app background and context for the production. After that, the next section follows the requirements that are required to be integrated and tested during then after development. 
To verify the success of each individual requirements, the proceeding section will comprise of different metrics of compliance. Lastly, the document will then cover additional appendixes for more visual context of the project specification.

➥ The practices that will be stricly followed when modifying contents of the specification are of the following: during initial screening, after finishing a single requirement fully, maintinance, or/and re-evaluation of the development cycle. 

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Product Perspective
➥ The product originated as a general use-case of the **acpa** project where the initial dependencies of classroom, quiz and metric based features are added with an additional community based interaction over career based result.
This is an **upstream open source** system and for the ownership of the product, should always start with the accredited of the original owner and **SHOULD NOT RESTRICT EXTERNAL ADDITION** to the list.

### 2.2 Product Functions
➥ Create and manage test

➥ Create and manage rooms

➥ Generate statistical metrics

➥ Send and received feedbacks

➥ Dashboard for user and admin

### 2.3 Product Constraints
➥ Must be deployed as a website and requires a host to maintain availability.

➥ Must use the following technology stack that consist of **Postgresql**, **React**, **ExpressJS & FastAPI**, and **NodeJS** (PREN)

➥ Must integrate **Docker** to deploy the project.

### 2.4 User Characteristics
➥ **student-** interacts with other users through comments and answer or make quizes/rooms.
➥ **admin-** updates the database and monitor changes.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
➥ Project architecture assumes the monolithic application. **Client**, **Server**, and **API** are the main modules for application. Client would consist of **ReactJS** while **Express JS & NodeJS** for server and **FastAPI** to API.

➥ Project assumes dependencies on **Tailwindcss**, **ThreeJS**, and **GSAP** for frontend libraries. While additional dependencies relies of **vitest** to unit test application and **storyboard** to design components.

### 3.1 External Interfaces
💬 _Specifies all external inputs and outputs, covering both required and provided interfaces._

➥ Provide interface definitions sufficient for implementation and test.

💡 Tips:
- Use interface control documents or schemas where appropriate and reference them here.

#### 3.1.1 User Interfaces
💬 _Describes how users interact with the system at a logical level._

➥ Define UI elements, flows, and standards to be followed (style guides, accessibility guidelines). Include layout constraints, common controls (e.g., help, search), keyboard shortcuts, error/empty-state behavior, and localization. Keep visual designs in a separate UI specification and reference them.

💡 Tips:
- Reference accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) and platform-specific guidelines.
- Consider organizing into subcategories for clarity: Usability/Accessibility (inputs/outputs and dialogs to fit user abstractions, abilities, and expectations), and Convenience.

#### 3.1.2 Hardware Interfaces
💬 _Details interactions with physical devices and platforms._

➥ Specify (un)supported device types, data/control signals, electrical or mechanical characteristics if relevant, and communication protocols. Include timing, throughput, and reliability expectations.

💡 Tips:
- Reference applicable hardware specs and certification requirements.

#### 3.1.3 Software Interfaces
💬 _Defines integrations with other software components and services._

➥ List connected systems (name and version), required or provided services/APIs, data items/messages exchanged, communication styles/protocols, and limit/error/timeout semantics. Identify shared data and ownership.

💡 Tips:
- Capture versioning and backward compatibility policies.
- Define authentication/authorization expectations for each integration.

### 3.2 Functional
💬 _Specifies the externally observable behaviors and functions the software shall provide._

➥ Organize functional requirements by feature, use case, or service. For each, describe triggers/inputs, processing/logic (at a black-box level), outputs, and error conditions. For AI behaviors, define determinism bounds (e.g., temperature), refusal criteria, safety rules, and human review points.

💡 Tips:
- Include edge cases and negative scenarios for completeness.
- For AI features, include fallback behaviors and thresholds for abstention.

### 3.5 Design and Implementation
💬 _Constraints or mandates affecting how the solution is designed, deployed, and maintained._

#### 3.5.1 Installation
💬 _Ensures the software runs smoothly in its target environments._

➥ Define (un)supported platforms/environments, prerequisites, installation methods, environment configuration (e.g., env vars, secrets), and rollback/uninstall procedures.

💡 Tips:
- Detail automation expectations (e.g., IaC, installer scripts, container images).
- Keep scaling mechanics (topology, multi-region) in 3.5.3 Distribution; keep scaling targets in 3.3 QoS.

#### 3.5.2 Build and Delivery
💬 _Defines the controls for building, packaging, and delivering software artifacts to ensure integrity, traceability, and reproducibility._

➥ Define how source code is transformed into deployable artifacts and moved through environments. Describe expectations for build reproducibility, dependency management, licensing, configuration management, artifact verification, and release promotion.

💡 Tips:
- Cross-reference 3.5.1 Installation and 3.5.10 Change Management for environment setup, versioning, and release traceability.
- Avoid operational topology details (those belong in 3.5.3 Distribution).

#### 3.5.5 Reusability
💬 _Encourages leveraging components across products or contexts when appropriate._

➥ Identify components intended for reuse and any constraints on their dependencies or technology choices. Specify modularization, API stability, packaging, and documentation to enable reuse.

#### 3.5.6 Portability
💬 _Ability to run on multiple platforms or environments with minimal changes._

➥ Specify (un)supported operating systems, hardware architectures, cloud providers, or container runtimes. Define abstraction layers, configuration policies, and externalization of environment-specific settings.

#### 3.5.8 Deadline
💬 _Schedule expectations that affect scope and prioritization._

➥ Specify key milestones, delivery dates, or phases/increments. Indicate dependencies between milestones and required readiness criteria.

💡 Tips:
- Use deadlines to guide apportioning of requirements (Section 2.6).

#### 3.5.9 Proof of Concept
💬 _Validates feasibility and de-risks critical assumptions before full-scale delivery._

➥ Define the objectives, scope, success criteria, and timebox for any POCs. Describe what will be validated (technical, usability, performance) and how results will influence requirements or design.

💡 Tips:
- Keep POCs narrowly focused and measurable. Focus on validation goals, not implementation details.
